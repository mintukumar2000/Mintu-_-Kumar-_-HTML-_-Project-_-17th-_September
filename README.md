Details of the project-

describations
1.Html 2.Sass 3.Bootstrap

implementions

 
Navbar - For Navbar i used bootstrap navbar component and modified the component and also used a transition effect on focus on searchbar.

Sidebar - for sidebar i have devided the whole body using row and column and took a part of it for the side bar and for responsive design i made the sidebar with 100% and used simple hover effect

Header - the rest of the column after sidebar is used to create 2 different rows 1 for headed and rest for body, now used simple row col to devide it equally and at the end i added the heading , vote and rating

now the next part was little complex coz i have to divide the content part into 3 different section- content - the content section was converted into 3 parts description, reviews, and news section and then simply used the card to display card and used simple hover effect on book now button

not comes the footer section as per design the footer section seems to be withing the side bar but if we have done this then in responsive design there will be more complexity as we have to hide the copyright text from sidebar and display it in footer so i decided to make a different footer component and blend that with side bar and change the component as per responsive design.

Advantage-
i have used the css variable for storing color code.

Hope you will like this idea ! Please share your feedback and also give some tips so that i can make this more optimized. Thank you
